This project was developed at the Next Level Week event by [**Rocketseat**](http://rocketseat.com.br). In a week we have the challenge of developing an website together.

The website chosen was **beautysalon**, a flexible website, the beautysalon is a landingpage that can be used as a template for many different projects.
